        <p class="intro-title-p">Welcome to the State of the Arts 2019 survey results!</p>

        <!-- <p>TLDR: These are the results of a census-style survey for visual artists by visual artists.</p> -->

        <p>State of the Arts is <strong>an anonymous census-style survey for visual artists</strong> intended to help artist gather and have free open
          access to critical information regarding trends in the arts communities of which they are a part. The goal of the survey is
          to <strong>assist artists in practical decision making</strong> and aid them in building a more inclusive, sustainable and vibrant art
          world by giving them free access to this information.</p>

        <p>The 2019 iteration of the survey was organized with the assistance of a small group of graduates from the San
          Francisco Art Institute and the Yale School of Art. <strong>It included 89 questions</strong> including but not
          limited to those that addressed the following.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What <strong>cities</strong> are artists living in?</li>
          <li>What kinds of <strong>jobs</strong> are we working?</li>
          <li>What <strong>subjects</strong> are we making work about?</li>
          <li>What <strong>mediums</strong> are we using?</li>
          <li>How are we <strong>selling</strong> our work?</li>
          <li>How are we <strong>getting shows</strong> ?</li>
          <li>How are we <strong>connecting</strong> with eachother?</li>
          <li>In what ways are we <strong>struggling</strong> ?</li>
          <li>In what ways are we <strong>thriving</strong> ?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For this <strong>first beta version of the survey</strong> we are proud to have had <strong>over 100 participants</strong> from across the United States that took the
          survey before December 31st 2019. <strong>Participation is still welcome</strong> however if you wish to fill out the survey.</p>

        <p><strong>If you would like to contribute ideas for the 2020 survey</strong> please don't hesitate to <strong>take the
        2019 survey.</strong>  All your information for 2019 will be aggregated to the rest of the participants data and fields are
        provided in each section where you can add new question ideas and thoughts on current questions.</p>

        <p><strong>As you peruse</strong> the results please keep in mind, <strong>this is a completely open-ended survey.</strong> We went to great lengths to
        make sure there was no singular agenda or bias at work in our selection of questions. The presentation for the data is
        intended to be similarly neutral. <strong>It's up to the reader to decide what the data might mean</strong> and what conclusions to
        draw.</p>

        <p>Have fun, take everything with a big grain of salt, when in doubt check out the raw data and <strong>if
        you find anything interesting</strong> like correlations or unexpected trends don't hesitate to <strong>share it on social media</strong> using <strong>#SotA2019</strong> or
        <strong>#SotASurvey</strong>!</p>
