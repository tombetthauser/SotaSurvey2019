### Non-Functional Goals:
1. Allow artists, gallerists or arts groups freely explore data from the State of the Arts Survey 2019.

### Current Functions / Features:
1. Build a aesthetically pleasing mobile-friendly page.
2. Use **vanilla JavaScript** without libraries like Bootstrap or Bulma.
3. Use the **D3 data library** to dynamically generate visaulizations from JSON data.
4. Have different color options like dark mode.

### Stretch Goals:
1. Build an external API and fetch data from it in real time using ajax.
2. Make a print option that dynamically constructs a print file / pdf from the data.
3. Overhaul data import flow and incorporate more D3 visualizations.
4. Try creating a set of D3 data visualizations from scratch.
5. Add a user customizable scatter plot generator for cross-referencing data.
6. Make a city-specific filter to localize project.

# How to Use the Project:
1. Peruse the data visualizations and look for interesting connections.
2. Check out the different color options for black and white and dark mode.
```
No special instructions, the page is ready for you to explore!
```
3. When you find something worth looking deeper into check out the seperate [data explorer](https://github.com/tombetthauser/arts_dataexplorer).
4. This tool will allow you to freely cross-reference the database and learn some basic SQL syntax.
5. If you find something of interest share it using #SotASurvey or #SotA2019
```
The data is all yours, poke around and try to discover something new!
